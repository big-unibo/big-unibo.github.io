The Business Intelligence Group studies the architectures, techniques, and methodologies aimed at extracting value from data in the most diverse business contexts.

The innovation brought by data ranges from the digital transformation of business operational processes to the adoption of artificial intelligence techniques for the extraction of knowledge and the automation of the most advanced processes, passing through the study of optimized algorithms for data extraction and analysis.

We carry out both theoretical research and practical studies, with the awareness that without the former there is no real innovation and that without the latter there is no real technology transfer. We are driven by curiosity and often deviate from our core research area to work on problems that emerge from the projects and business contexts we face.
