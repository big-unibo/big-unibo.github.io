# Data Platforms and Artificial Intelligence: Challenges and Applications

This PhD course discusses the transition from *big data architectures* to the broader notion of *data platforms* and introduces some of the research opportunities and open challenges related to the synergy of data platforms and artificial intelligence.

It is held within the [PhD in Computer Science and Engineering](https://disi.unibo.it/it/didattica/dottorati-di-ricerca/computer-science-and-engineering/) at the University of Bologna.

## Program

The course is subdivided into the following parts.

- An introduction to the world of big data is given, so as to bring up to speed the students that have no prior knowledge on the subject.
- An in-depth analysis of the polyglot persistence theme is given, introducing the concepts of multistores and polystores and the techniques to query heterogeneous distributed database systems.
- The main techniques based on artificial intelligence for the smart management of data platforms are presented, with particular focus on discussing the main issues related to metadata generation, maintenance, and exploitation.

## Exam

Students requiring an exam will be asked to produce an essay about possible intersections between their research interests and the topics/open issues presented in this course.

To get CFUs, write and send me a short essay (about 4/5 pages using this IEEE template)

- Deepen at least one of the covered topics
- Discuss relationships between your research interests and the topics presented in the course

Or... submit a paper! We have an open special issue on these topics

- [Data Management, Integration, and Interoperability](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/electronics/special_issues/Q710A28880), Journal: Electronics, IF 2.6
- Closes Dec 31, 2025 (let me know if you are interested and need more time!)


## Participation

Students willing to follow the course are kindly asked to [send a notification of interest](mailto:m.francia@unibo.it?subject=[DP2526] Notification of interest) to the teacher, indicating

1. existing issues with the indicated schedule (if any),
2,the background level on big data, and
3. whether the course will be followed online or in presence.

The notification is neither binding nor required, but it is asked for organization purposes.

## Teacher

[Matteo Francia](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/m.francia/) is Assistant Professor at the University of Bologna, Cesena. He teaches Big Data and Cloud Platforms at the Master's Degree in Digital Trasformation Management. His research activities are focused on the topics of big data, NoSQL databases, social and conversational business intelligence, trajectory data analysis, precision agriculture.
