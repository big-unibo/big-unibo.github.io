# From Big Data to Data Platform - Research and Challenges

This PhD course discusses the transition from *big data architectures* to the broader notion of *data platforms* and introduces some of the research opportunities and open challenges around this topic.

It is held within the [PhD in Computer Science and Engineering](https://disi.unibo.it/it/didattica/dottorati-di-ricerca/computer-science-and-engineering/) at the University of Bologna.

## Program

The course is subdivided into three parts. In the first part, an introduction to the world of big data is given, so as to bring up to speed the students that have no prior knowledge on the subject. In the second part, an in-depth analysis of the polyglot persistence theme is given, introducing the concepts of multistores and polystores and the techniques to query heterogeneous distributed database systems. In the last part, the metadata challenge is presented to discuss the main issues related to metadata generation, maintenance, and exploitation.
