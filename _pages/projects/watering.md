# Method and system for soil-moisture monitoring
Precision farming market value as of 2023: 9.7 billions$, forecasting 21.9$ in 2031

Precision farming advantages

- Greater efficiency and greater predictability
- Higher profit margins
- Soil monitoring
- Higher yield

Current technologies make it possible to assess both the quantity and quality of soil and plants, along with the use of advanced tools to monitor the soil

NEED: operative solutions able to assess soil-moisture condition and optimize water resources

Our goal is to implement an irrigation system capable of maintaining optimal humidity conditions

WHAT ARE THE FEATURES OF SUCH AN EFFICIENT SYSTEM?

System independent by soil features (no need for texture analysis) 
No need for start up/training steps (system fully capable from day 0)
Customization of the system based on crops and phenological states

Our system consists of a 2D and 3D sensor grid to detect quantitative soil features (e.g., humidity)



Applying a functional profile of quantitative values enables the generation of a detailed profile. This can be implemented in a machine learning algorithm based on a neural network to achieve a vision of humidity profiles within a specified time range.

The number of usable sensors is limited. Achieving optimal precision levels (in centimeters) requires the use of a mapping function to estimate humidity in sensorless spots. 







Soil Feature Unaware - SFU: exploiting sensor measurement only. 
Soil Feature Aware- SFA: exploiting hydrological flux data to consider non-linearities and obtain a more precise estimation.

The ideal humidity profile is defined by agricultural technicians in the form of a moisture matrix
