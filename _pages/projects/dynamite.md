# DyNamiTE - Digital fightiNg Tax Evasion

The project, aimed at studying innovative techniques for identyfying potential tax evaders, is funded by the <A HREF="http://www.fondazionecarispcesena.it/" TARGET="_TOP">Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Cesena</A>, and is carried out on a real case study provided by <A HREF="http://www.comune.cesena.fc.it/home" TARGET="_TOP">Comune di Cesena</A> in collaboration with <A HREF="http://http://www.onit.it/" TARGET="_TOP">Onit Group</A>.

The project started from the consideration that Municipalities, and more in general, public Administrations have nowadays access to a huge amount of information: internally-managed ones, open data, and data managed by other public bodies. Unfortunately such data are typically "dirty" and poorly integrated, while the full exploitation of such data could impact on the effectiveness of the social strategies thus enabling several smart applications.

Our activity goes in two directions: 

<ul>
<li> <B>Database integration</B>: we coupled standard database integration technique 
with smart cleansing and approximate joins one. This allowed to increase up to 20% the 
percentage of unmatching records.</li>
<li> <B>Smart exploitation of integrated and cleansed data</B>: we prototyped two 
different applications in the area of tax analysis:
    <ul>
    <li><I>Tax evaders identification</I>: we applied data mining techniques to the 
    integrated data to identify evasion pattern in the area of real estates and 
    undeclared rents. Short lists of potential evaders returned by our techniques 
    have been verified by the tax department of the municipality that started the 
    tax assessment process.</li>
    <li><I>Fiscal Equity simulation</I>: we created a what-if prototype simulating 
    the impact of local taxes on different types of families (e.g., retired couples, 
    young couples, single, couples with 1,2,3 children). The goal of the application 
    is to analyze the variation of the distribution of taxes determined by changes in 
    tax parameters (e.g., tax shares, exemption thresholds). The integrated data are 
    necessary to estimates the average wealth of different types of families and the 
    impact of taxes.</li>
