# Token-based system for peer-review

The peer-review system is facing a critical imbalance: while paper submissions continue to grow, reviewer availability remains stagnant, resulting in longer decision times and increased editorial workloads. Voluntary and reward-based initiatives have proven insufficient in resolving this issue. We propose a token-based mechanism that transforms peer-reviewing from a voluntary activity into a reciprocal obligation. Authors are required to spend tokens earned through reviewing in order to submit papers, ensuring a balanced review-to-submission ratio. Supported by a developed simulator, the token-based model significantly reduces editorial queues and review times, while incentivizing timely and high-quality reviews.

## Simulator

For reproducibility, the code of the simulator is available at [https://github.com/big-unibo/token-based-peer-review/]().

## Survey

From March to April 2025, we opened an [anonymous survey](https://forms.gle/pDZbro8WhbrqDnLfA) among Chief and Associate Editors of the computer science scientific journals, chosen by varying different areas, publishers, and quality of the journals. Out of 100 invitations, we collected 30 answers. The aggregated outcomes are here reported.
