## Survey

<!--We implement a smart irrigation system capable of maintaining optimal humidity conditions.
In particular, our system:

- Is independent of the soil features (no need for texture analysis) 
- Does not require cold-start training steps (working from day 0)
- Is customizable based on crops and phenological states

Our system consists of a 2D (or 3D) sensor grid to detect quantitative soil features (e.g., humidity) with a limited number of sensors.

Given the sensor data, achieving a soil profile with a precision level in the order of centimeters requires the use of a mapping function to estimate humidity in sensorless spots. 
The profiling function can be implemented with a machine learning algorithm based on neural networks.

We provide two main profiling functions:

- Soil Feature Unaware (SFU): exploiting sensor measurement only. 
- Soil Feature Aware (SFA): exploiting hydrological flux data to consider non-linearities and obtain a more precise estimation.

The ideal humidity profile is defined by agricultural technicians in the form of a moisture matrix that can be adapted to the irrigation system.

Then, the system modulates irrigation to achieve the desired profile.

Tests were conducted on a yellow kiwi farm in Brisighella (RA) in comparison to the farmer's previous performances.

Empirical results show that the system:

- creates 2D and 3D moisture profiles of the field with a level of detail in cubic meters and centimeters
- enables a 40% reduction in irrigation water usage
- reduced fertilizer costs due to decreased soil depletion
- improves the quality and size of the fruits
