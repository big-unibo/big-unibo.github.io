# ASSO: Automated Schemaless Stream Overseer

<img src="/images/projects/asso_architecture.png" width="500">

In the big data era, real-time tracking and evaluation of streaming information are essential for delivering prompt insights.
The schemaless nature of streaming data introduces substantial analytical challenges: since schemas are constantly changing in an unpredictable way, a continuous query issued over the stream can quickly become obsolete, losing purpose and effectiveness. <strong>ASSO</strong> is a solution for dynamic monitoring and analysis of schemaless streams.
ASSO considers the overlapping sliding window paradigm, interpreting data streams and offering an intentional view of their schemas, while dynamically adjusting continuous queries to accommodate schema evolution.
