# Data modeling and NoSQL applications for data platforms

This PhD course discusses the issues related to data modeling and NoSQL applications and introduces some of the research opportunities and open challenges related to their synergy with data platforms.

It is held within the [PhD in Computer Science](???) at the University of Tours, France.

## Program

The course is subdivided into the following parts.
- An introduction to the world of big data is given to explain why we need non-relational data models.
- An in-depth analysis of Document-based and (property) Graph data models is given.
- An in-depth analysis of the polyglot persistence theme is given, introducing the concepts of multistores and polystores and the techniques to query heterogeneous distributed database systems.
- Techniques for the smart management of data platforms are presented, with a particular focus on discussing the main issues related to storing and exploiting lineage data with graph databases.
