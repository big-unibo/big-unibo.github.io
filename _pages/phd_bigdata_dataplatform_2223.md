# Data Platforms and Artificial Intelligence: Challenges and Applications

This PhD course discusses the transition from *big data architectures* to the broader notion of *data platforms* and introduces some of the research opportunities and open challenges related to the synergy of data platforms and artificial intelligence.

It is held within the [PhD in Computer Science and Engineering](https://disi.unibo.it/it/didattica/dottorati-di-ricerca/computer-science-and-engineering/) at the University of Bologna.

## Program

The course is subdivided into the following parts.
- An introduction to the world of big data is given, so as to bring up to speed the students that have no prior knowledge on the subject.
- An in-depth analysis of the polyglot persistence theme is given, introducing the concepts of multistores and polystores and the techniques to query heterogeneous distributed database systems.
- The main techniques based on artificial intelligence for the smart management of data platforms are presented, with particular focus on discussing the main issues related to metadata generation, maintenance, and exploitation.
- Finally, challeges and applications related to the field of precision agricolture are presented.
